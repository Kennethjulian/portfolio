                    <p> 
                        Hello, friend.
                        "Hello, friend?" That's lame.
                        I would be more than happy to learn your name and more about you.
                        But thats right your here to learn about me. I formerly worked in the construction industry building scaffolding and welding. 
                        I did this for 8 years, and I felt like I was a trapped robot. I always loved technology, computers, and video games; but, 
                        I thought I would need to go to college to enter that field. After my wrist injury, I quit construction. 
                        My mother suggested I try a coding boot camp and thatâ€™s when I discoverd my passion for code. 
                        I love problem solving and expressing creativity. I now consider myself a Web Designer proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the last 2 years, 
                        I have focused on web development. 
                        I hope to one day change the world.
